This is a workshop I ran for the Hackers at Cambridge society (whilst I was a committee member). You can see it on the society website here:  https://hackersatcambridge.com/workshops/deep-learning

It's based off tutorials I wrote on my website e.g. https://mukulrathi.co.uk/demystifying-deep-learning/feed-forward-neural-network/
