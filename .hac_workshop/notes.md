## Getting started with the code:

Instructions for implementing the neural network are all in the Google Colaboratory notebook in the repo.

To load the notebook, head to [Google Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com/) and click the "Upload" tab,  (if you have cloned the repo) and select the Intro to Deep Learning.ipynb file on your computer. You can also load directly from GitHub if you click the GitHub tab and enter https://github.com/hackersatcambridge/workshop-deep-learning/blob/master/Intro_To_Deep_Learning.ipynb in the search field.

When you initially try to run a cell, there will be a "Warning, this notebook wasn't authored by Google" - uncheck the "reset all runtimes" box and click "run anyway".

Finally, to run the code you can just click the "play" button on each cell to execute the code in that cell.

If you get stuck, ask a demonstrator (there is also a fully-implemented notebook in the repo for reference). 


## Diving deeper: (no pun intended)

To read up more about the neural net we're coding up, there are a couple of blog posts on [neural nets](https://mukul-rathi.github.io/2018/08/29/FeedForwardNeuralNet.html) and [backpropagation](https://mukul-rathi.github.io/2018/08/31/Backpropagation.html). 

The [blog](https://mukul-rathi.github.io/blog.html) also covers the content in the slides in more depth (and more maths, if you're interested in that).
